/**
 * Pubsub Service API
 * ## Goal  The goal of this API is to be able to use pubsub on any device and under any condition to build decentralized application. Powerful and well connected machine can use pubsub directly, but different reasons can make that difficult. Notable one are mobile or IOT devices: bad networking (NAT, ...), battery life, available compute or application lifespan.  This API allow to delegate to a more powerful instance or a service provider this role of interacting with pubsub. As this API is asynchronous at its core, it allows to instruct that provider to listen to topics, sleep, and come back later to retrieve messages.   ## Design Principles  - effort is made to allow client to operate with the minimum of requests, and within a limited time window. An example of that is /join that returns before the topic is actually subscribed and ready. - as the real world as shown, there is a gradient of necessary validation of received message, ranging from generic or protocol layer (ex:  deduplicate messages, max message size) to application specific (non-conforming message, abuse ...). All of those would usually be done in the same place if the application directly perform pubsub, but this is not the case here. The choice here is to split those into server side (the generic part, including some form of spam prevention) and the client side (anything that require specific logic or data), and have a way for the client to hint the server about those bad message or PeerID. - provide a versioned API from the start  ## Versioning  This API is expected to be hosted at an URL with a path ending with `/v1`, so that future major versions, if any, can be hosted side by side. An example of that would be `https://pubsub-service.example.com/v1`.  ## Expected Usage Patterns  ### Subscribing to a Topic  This first step to use a pubsub service is to join a topic, and optionally define limits. For example, the following will join the `foo` topic for a maximum of 3600s, have a queue of 10 messages of maximum 1000 bytes, and drop old messages if the queue fills up:  `POST /join?topic=foo&queue-length=10&queue-policy=drop-old&timeout=3600&max-message-size=1000`  The service will confirm with a 202, and returns the effective limits as a confirmation. Those limits can be restricted by the service if they are outside of the maximum advertised in the /discovery endpoints:  ```json {   \"queue-length\": 10,   \"queue-policy\": \"drop-old\",   \"timeout\": 3600,   \"max-message-size\": 1000 } ```  ### Publishing and Reading Messages  We now can publish a message, by passing it as the body of the following request:  `POST /publish?topic=foo`  We can read messages in the queue:  `POST /read?topic=foo&count=2`  Here, we ask for a maximum of 2 messages. The service returns them, and inform us that there is 8 more in the queue, and that 2 have been dropped due to the queue filling up:  ```json {   \"messages-dropped\": 2,   \"messages-remaining\": 8,   \"messages\": [     {       \"from\": \"QmdXGaeGiVA745XorV1jr11RHxB9z4fqykm6xCUPX1aTJo\",       \"data\": \"aGVsbG8gd29ybGQK\"     },     {       \"from\": \"QmdXGaeGiVA745XorV1jr11RHxB9z4fqykm6xCUPX1aTJo\",       \"data\": \"aG93IGFyZSB0aGluZ3MgdG9kYXk/Cg==\"     }   ] } ```  ### Maintaining Active Subscription  To avoid keeping alive irrelevant topic subscriptions, services have a timeout defined per topic. If the client is not active on that topic (/join, /publish, /read or /read-all), the service consider that the client is gone and teardown that subscription. To avoid that, clients should signal liveness with a query to one of those endpoints, which will reset the timeout to the maximum duration defined during /join.  Which endpoint to use is up to the client. For example, a client that does read message might want to periodically /read or /read-all, while a client only writing messages might want to periodically use /join again if not enough messages are published.  ## Multi-Tenant Considerations  This specification doesn't enforce anything about how multi-tenancy should be implemented. It is however expected that an authentication layer (BasicAuth, OAuth, UCAN ...) may be added, which should provide the relevant client identifier to return the appropriate responses for that specific client. This is however not a requirement, as an implementation could serve a single client without authentication.

* The <code>index</code> module provides access to constructors for all the classes which comprise the public API.
* <p>
* An AMD (recommended!) or CommonJS application will generally do something equivalent to the following:
* <pre>
* var PubsubServiceApi = require('index'); // See note below*.
* var xxxSvc = new PubsubServiceApi.XxxApi(); // Allocate the API class we're going to use.
* var yyyModel = new PubsubServiceApi.Yyy(); // Construct a model instance.
* yyyModel.someProperty = 'someValue';
* ...
* var zzz = xxxSvc.doSomething(yyyModel); // Invoke the service.
* ...
* </pre>
* <em>*NOTE: For a top-level AMD script, use require(['index'], function(){...})
* and put the application logic within the callback function.</em>
* </p>
* <p>
* A non-AMD browser application (discouraged) might do something like this:
* <pre>
* var xxxSvc = new PubsubServiceApi.XxxApi(); // Allocate the API class we're going to use.
* var yyy = new PubsubServiceApi.Yyy(); // Construct a model instance.
* yyyModel.someProperty = 'someValue';
* ...
* var zzz = xxxSvc.doSomething(yyyModel); // Invoke the service.
* ...
* </pre>
